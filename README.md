# AI Learning Log

This repository documents my structured learning journey in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Python, and systems engineering.

The purpose of this repository is to build deep understanding through:

- Clear explanations in my own words  
- Small experiments and benchmarks  
- Debugging notes and lessons learned  
- Connections between theory and real AI/ML systems  

This is not a collection of random notes.  
It is a structured technical journal.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by learning domains:

00-environment/ # Tooling, Git, package managers, shell, setup
01-python-foundations/ # Core Python concepts
02-advanced-python/ # OOP, decorators, file handling
03-numpy/ # Numerical computing and performance
08-statistics/ # Statistical foundations for ML


More sections will be added as the course progresses.

## What Each Entry Includes

Each topic typically contains:

- Plain explanation  
- Technical breakdown  
- Why the concept exists  
- Where it appears in AI/ML systems  
- Mini experiments (when applicable)  
- Key engineering insights  

---

## Goal

To move from learning concepts to thinking like an AI/ML engineer — with attention to systems, performance, reproducibility, and real-world constraints.
